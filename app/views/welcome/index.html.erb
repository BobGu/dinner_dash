            We serve you better pie than your grandma can make. Sure, we have the
            sweet classics like Apple and Key Lime.
          </strong></p>
          <p class="lead"><strong>
            First though, let us hit you with some savory pies
            to start; like our pulled pork, chicken pot pie, or the one and only
            - Baltimore Bomb.
          </strong></p>
          <p class="lead"><strong>
            All our pies are made with traditional crusts, but we don't mind going gluten free.
          </strong></p>
          <h1 class="cover-heading">So come on in, and treat yo' self.</h1>
